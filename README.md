UXNSMAL or SMAL is a [concatenative][] [stack-oriented][] and staticaly typed
programming language made for [UXN][] virtual machine

[concatenative]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language
[stack-oriented]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming
[UXN]: https://100r.co/site/uxn.html

## TODO

List of features i want to implement

- [ ] Syntax sugar
	- [x] If-else and While blocks
	- [ ] Enums
	- [ ] Including/importing any file in any place
- [ ] Better error reporting
	- [ ] Collect as many errors as possible before exiting.\
	      Currently only one error is being reported
	- [ ] Help messages with small examples based on the error context
- [ ] Code optimization\
      Currently there is no optimizations at all
	- [ ] Dead code elimination (code that will never be executed)
	- [ ] Function inlining
	- [ ] Compile-time evaluation
	- [ ] [Peephole optimization][]
- [ ] [Metaprogramming][]?
- [ ] Something else?...

## Building

```sh
cargo build --release
cp ./target/release/uxnsmal-cli .
./uxnsmal-cli examples/hello.smal
uxnemu output.rom
```

or

```sh
cargo run --release -- examples/hello.smal
uxnemu output.rom
```

## Examples

<!-- TODO: would be cool to add tests for the examples in README.md -->

"Hello world"

See `examples/print.smal` for more explanation

```uxnsmal
const byte Console.write { 0x18 }

// Print "Hello world!!" to the console
fun on-reset ( -> ) {
	"Hello world!!\n\0" -> (str-ptr)

	while load-k 0 neq {
		load-k Console.write output
		str-ptr inc
	}

	str-ptr pop
}
```

## Reference

### Literals

#### Numbers

There are two types of numbers in UXNSMAL: `byte` and `short`

Byte is represented simply as a number (e.g. `255`) and store as, let's say, one byte (8 bits).\
Short is represented as a number followed by an asterisk `*` (e.g. `65535*`) and stored as two bytes (16 bits).

You can specify radix of both byte and short by prefixing them with:

- `0x` - hexadecimal
- `0b` - binary
- `0o` - octal
- no prefix - decimal

Example:

```uxnsmal
10 // push byte
0xff // this is also byte
256 // this will error because it exceeded its max value (255)
0b10100011 // also byte

256* // this one is short because of *
0xffff*
```

#### Strings and characters

Strings are sequences of ASCII characters inside `"` (e.g. `"hey\0"`).\
Chars are a single ASCII character inside `'` (e.g. `'a'`, `'\n'`).

String and chars are significantly different from each other:

- Using string literal will push its [absolute realative address short][]
  (`ptr2 byte`) onto the working stack, then this string will be implicitly
  stored in the ROM itself

- Using char literal will push `byte` associated with this ASCII char onto the
  working stack

[absolute realative address short]: https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal_labels.html

Both strings and chars can have these escaped chars inside:

- `\0` -> `0` (null character)
- `\a` -> `0x07` (bell)
- `\b` -> `0x08` (backspace)
- `\t` -> `\t` (tab)
- `\n` -> `\n` (new line)
- `\v` -> `0x0B` (vertical tab)
- `\f` -> `0x0C` (form feed)
- `\r` -> `\r` (carriage ret)
- `\\` -> `\` (backslash)
- `\'` -> `'` (single quote)
- `\"` -> `"` (double quotes)

UTF-8/32 is not handled niether for chars or strings, so it can produce crazy results.

Example:

```uxnsmal
"hello\0" // push `ptr2 byte` to this string
load // -> 'h', load the first char of the string

'\n' // -> 0x0a, push "new line" char byte
'ab' // this will error because only one char must be inside `'`
```

### Types

**You cannot define custom types yet...**

There are 5 built-in types in UXNSMAL:

- `byte` - 1 byte
- `short` - 2 bytes
- `ptr <type>` (byte pointer) - always 1 byte
- `ptr2 <type>` (short pointer) - always 2 bytes
- `funptr <signature>` (function pointer) - always 2 bytes

You can't do anything interesting with function pointers yet besides passing it
into device ports.

Example:

```uxnsmal
// var <type> <name> - variable definition
// ( <input-types...> -- <output-types...> ) - procedure function signature
// ( -> ) - vector function signature

var byte my-var // define variable with type of `byte`
var ptr2 byte ptr-to-string // variable with type of `short pointer to byte`

// This type is a pointer to a function that expects `byte` as an input
var funptr ( byte -- ) a

// You can nest types as many times as you want
var ptr ptr ptr2 ptr ptr2 funptr ( funptr(->) ptr byte -- short ) my-var
```

TODO: to be done... i'm a little tired right now
